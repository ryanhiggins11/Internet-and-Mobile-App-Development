Main Purpose of my app that i developed is a simple timetable app for students in which they are greeted
with a homepage that has 5 buttons on it all displaying the days of the weeek (Monday - Friday Inclusive).

Then When a button is clicked onto you are brought to a page which has the numbers along the side from 8am to 6pm.
I chose 8am to 6pm as i thought this was the appropriate times as usually students would need to enter classes during them
timeframes as class usually finishes at 6pm.

Then when the user clicks on the edit button at the bottom of the screen it will then allow you to add the stuff you want for each 
time, also then when you press submit it will then store the information.

** Visual studio 2017 would not work on my laptop so i had to use visual studio 2019 which i hope isnt an issue**
** This is my design document as i am repeating i didnt realise the design doc had to be uploaded at the date specified **
